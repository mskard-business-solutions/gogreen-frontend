          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed animate-fadeInUp delay-100">
            An engineer and architect by profession, he believed precision, discipline and thoughtful design were essential not only for buildings, but for businesses, products and life itself.

What started as a modest effort steadily evolved into a respected name in irrigation manufacturing, built on trust and technical excellence.
